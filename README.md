# Babylon Boilerplate

A boilerplate for BabylonJS.

## Commands

* Installation: `yarn install`
* Development: `yarn start`
* Production build: `yarn build`

## Directory structure

* `src/`
  * `src/Game/` - All of your unique game logic goes in here.
  * `src/Game/index.ts` - The main file that boots up the game.
  * `src/Framework/` - All of your reusable game stuff goes in here. Think of it as a collection of classes, helpers, managers, ... that you'll be able to reuse in your next game.
  * `src/Resources/` - All of your static assets, such as 3D models, CSS, audio and more.

## Concepts

### GameManager

That is our main object in the game. It handles the boot up of the game & contains the main, static variables (engine, canvas element, input manager, currently active world/level, ...). You can use it all across your codebase, as all the important variables are static.

#### GameManager - InputManager

Handles all the input stuff for the keyboard, mouse & gamepad(-s). The most important methods here are are `GameManager.inputManager.getAxes()` and `GameManager.inputManager.getActions()`. It will return back the axes values & action booleans, that you specified as your input bindings.

#### GameManager - InputManager - InputBindings

This is the class, that will supply your input manager with your bindings. View the `src/Framework/Input/Bindings/InputBindingsDefault` class as an example.

### World

All your worlds should go inside the `src/Game/Worlds/` directory. Your world class needs to extend the `src/Framework/Worlds/World.ts`. Your world should then include the following methods:

* `World::start()` - This will be executed once everything is ready and loaded.
* `World::load()` - Can/should be used when preloading assets/resources. Must always return a promise.
* `World::update()` - This method is ran on every tick, so you can use it for things like the PlayerController.

### Model/texture usage

Because we always want to get the newest assets, especially when they change, we can do that easily by just adding the following:

In your world file, import the asset as following:

```javascript
import vehicleModelUrl from '../../Resources/models/vehicle.glb';

return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  SceneLoader.LoadAssetContainer(
    '',
    vehicleModelAsset,
    this.scene,
    (container: AssetContainer) => {
      // Do something with it
    }
  );
});
```

### Shader usage

```javascript
import defaultFragmentShader from '../../Resources/shaders/default.fragment.fx';
import defaultVertexShader from '../../Resources/shaders/default.vertex.fx';

// https://doc.babylonjs.com/advanced_topics/introToShaders/shaderMaterial
const shaderMaterial = new ShaderMaterial(
  'shaderMaterial',
  GameManager.scene,
  {
    fragmentSource: defaultFragmentShader,
    vertexSource: defaultVertexShader,
  },
  {
    attributes: [
      'position',
      'normal',
      'uv',
    ],
    uniforms: [
      'world',
      'worldView',
      'worldViewProjection',
      'view',
      'projection',
      'time',
      'direction',
    ],
    needAlphaBlending: true,
    needAlphaTesting: true,
  }
);
```

Same goes for all the other file types mentioned in webpacks's [url-loader](https://github.com/bobalazek/babylon-boilerplate/blob/master/webpack.common.js#L68). Note: if you want to add new file types there, you must also add them inside the [declaration file](https://github.com/bobalazek/babylon-boilerplate/blob/master/src/declarations.d.ts).
